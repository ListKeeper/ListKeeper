## About

ListKeeper is a safety app disguised as an unsuspecting todo list app for when you find yourself in a dangerous situation. Think of ListKeeper as the virtual "Angel Shot" giving you the ability to stealthily send a coded message to those you most trust.

This project was built for the MintBean Social Justice Hackathon from December 4-10 2020

We built the app using:

- NextJS, ReactJS, MaterialUI on the front end
- Twillio and SendGrid for the messaging integration
- MongoDB on the backend
- CircleCI and #Vercel for deployment. \*\*Not currently deployed
